# Project-3-OrgoSpace
This is my Project 3 of WDI18 - As a writer, I'm passionate about helping others succeed in reaching their career goals. With technology growing as rapidly as it is, our generation struggles with social skills, emotional skills, and selling ourselves. This project is a stepping stone in my career as a resume writer and a developer to test my skills of learning Express - Axios - React. I have created an employee based database to neatly organize clients and their portfolios. The employee will have clients and those clients will have portfolios.
